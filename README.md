# README: Replication code and data for "The Black-White Lifetime Earnings Gap"

## Overview

The code in this replication package (Karger and Wray 2024b) constructs the analysis datasets used to reproduce the figures and tables in the following article (Karger and Wray 2024a):

Ezra Karger and Anthony Wray. "The Black-White Lifetime Earnings Gap." Forthcoming at _Explorations in Economic History_. 101629. [https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eeh.2024.101629](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eeh.2024.101629).

Some public-use datasets from IPUMS USA cannot be included in the repository. These must first be downloaded using the IPUMS data extraction system before running our code. Instructions for accessing data from IPUMS USA are provided below.

The code is executed using Stata version 18 and R version 4.4.1. To recreate our paper, navigate to the home directory `bw-lifetime-earnings-replication` and open the Stata project `bw-lifetime-earnings-replication.stpr`, then run the do file `0_run_all.do`. This will run all of the code to create the figures and tables in the manuscript, including the online appendix. The replicator should expect the code to run for about 5 hours.

### Details on each Data Source

The data used to support the findings of this study have been deposited in a replication package hosted at OpenICPSR ([project openicpsr-209621](https://doi.org/10.3886/E209621V1)). Data are made available under a MIT license. Here we provide further details on the sources for all datasets used in the study:

The paper uses data on survivorship rates per 100,000 births by age, race, and sex. The data was retrieved from [Table 20](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvsr/nvsr64/nvsr64_11.pdf) of "United States Life Tables, 2011" published in _National Vital Statistics Reports_ Vol. 64 No. 11 (Arias 2015).

Annual birth counts by race come from the [Center for Disease Control (CDC)] and were retrieved from [Table 1-1](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/statab/t001x01.pdf) "Live Births, Birth Rates, and Fertility Rates, by Race: United States, 1909-2000" (Hamilton et al. 2003).

Data on average earnings by year prior to 1940 were obtained from [series D722-727 on page 44 of Chapter D (Labor)](https://www2.census.gov/library/publications/1975/compendia/hist_stats_colonial-1970/hist_stats_colonial-1970p1-chD.pdf) of the "Historical Statistics of the United States, Colonial Times to 1970" (United States. Bureau of the Census, 1975).

Federal individual income tax rate data were downloaded from a [Tax Foundation](https://files.taxfoundation.org/legacy/docs/fed_individual_rate_history_nominal.pdf) report (Tax Foundation 2013). Data were downloaded in PDF format and were exported to `xlsx` format using Adobe Acrobat and then saved as a `.csv`.

Data on federal individual income tax personal exemptions were downloaded from a [Tax Policy Center](https://taxpolicycenter.org/sites/default/files/legacy/taxfacts/content/PDF/historical_parameters.pdf) report (Tax Policy Center 2015). Data were downloaded in PDF format and were exported to `xlsx` format using Adobe Acrobat and then saved as a `.csv`.

The paper uses __IPUMS USA__ [full count U.S. Census microdata](https://usa.ipums.org/usa/full_count.shtml) constructed from source data provided by the United States Census Bureau (Ruggles et al. 2024a,b). IPUMS USA does not allow users to redistribute IPUMS-USA Full-Count data, but these data can be freely downloaded from the [IPUMS-USA extract system](https://usa.ipums.org/usa-action/variables/group). Users will first need to [register for an account](https://uma.pop.umn.edu/usa/user/new) with IPUMS USA by filling out the registration form, including a brief description of the project, and agreeing to the conditions of use. In lieu of providing a copy of the data files as part of this archive, we include codebook files for each of the five full count extracts used (1900-1940), which provide information on the variables and observations to be selected.

The paper also uses samples of the 1900-2000 US Censuses of Population and 2000-2014 American Community Survey (ACS) provided by __IPUMS USA__ (Ruggles et al.Â 2024a). The data can be downloaded from [IPUMS USA](https://usa.ipums.org/usa-action/samples). We include the codebook file (`usa_00064.cbk`) provided by IPUMS along with the data. The data was downloaded on 21 July 2021. Interested  replicators can use the list of variables in the codebook file to generate an identical extract from the IPUMS system. In such cases with non-full count data, IPUMS USA does not allow for redistribution without permission, but their [terms of use](https://usa.ipums.org/usa/terms.shtml) makes an exception for users to "publish a subset of the data to meet journal requirements for accessing data related to a particular publication."

Data on age-adjusted death rates (deaths per 100,000) and life expectancy at birth by race and sex come from the [Center for Disease Control](https://data.cdc.gov/NCHS/NCHS-Death-rates-and-life-expectancy-at-birth/w9j2-ggv5/about_data) and National Center for Health Statistics (2015).

The occupational income score data in Figure 9 are based on the implementation of Collins and Wanamker (2022) by Ward (2023). The data and code used to construct the measures come from the replication package of Ward (2023).

## Computational requirements

### Software Requirements

- The replication package contains all Stata programs used for computation in the `analysis/scripts/libraries/stata` directory.
- The download and installation of R packages used in the study is initiated from Stata by the `0_run_all.do` do file which calls the `renv/activate.R` and `analysis/programs/_restore_renv.R` scripts. R packages will be downloaded and installed in the `renv/libraries/` directory.

All software used for Stata is contained within the `analysis/scripts/libraries/stata` directory. If you would like to use updated versions of this code (which may be different than the versions we used) you may install stata packages using the `analysis/scripts/code/_install_stata_packages.do` file. Note that you may need to delete and then reinstall all the packages in `analysis/scripts/libraries/stata/g` related to gtools since gtools will install machine specific libraries.

Packages and version control related to R are controlled using `renv` package. You may need to install the `renv` package before proceeding (`install.packages("renv")`). Metadata on the package versions used in the study is contained in the `renv.lock` file. The exact versions of the R packages used in the study are downloaded and installed by the `0_run_all.do` do file. If you wish to run the analysis in R without using Stata, opening the `bw-lifetime-earnings-replication.Rproj` R project file in RStudio will automatically activate `renv`. Packages can be manually installed by running the `renv::restore()` command.

- Stata (Version 18)
- R 4.4.1

Portions of the code require data to be unzipped using a program such as 7-Zip.

### Controlled Randomness

The code does not include any instances of controlled randomness.

### Memory, Runtime, Storage Requirements

#### Summary

Approximate time needed to reproduce the analyses on a standard (2024) desktop machine:

- 5 hours

Approximate storage space needed:

- 45 GB - 50 GB

#### Details

The code was last run on a **HP EliteBook 840 G8 Notebook PC with a 11th Gen Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-1165G7 @ 2.80GHz, 2803 Mhz, 4 core processor, running Microsoft Windows 11 Enterprise with 64 GB of RAM and 400GB of free space**. Computation took **5 hours 7 minutes 49 seconds** to run.

Each section of the code took the following time to run

- Unzip packages: 14 seconds
- Build data for main analysis: 62 minutes
- Main figures and tables: 21 seconds
- Build robustness data for Figure 9: 4 hours and 5 minutes
- Figure 9: 14 seconds

## Description of programs/code

- The program `0_run_all.do` will run all programs in the sequence listed below. If running in any order other than the one outlined above, your results may differ.
  - Stata packages (`.ado` files) been included in the `analysis/scripts/libraries` directory. The `0_run_all.do` file unzips the libraries folder and sets the `.ado` directories appropriately.
  - Information on R package versions are recorded by the `renv` package. The `0_run_all.do` file uses the `rscript` Stata command to run `renv/activate.R` which activates `renv` and `analysis/scripts/programs/_restore_renv.R` which restores the R environment by installing the correct versions of the project libraries.
- The program `analysis/scripts/code/0.1_construct_tax_rates.R` computes income tax rates and personal exemption amounts for each year.
- The program `analysis/scripts/code/1.1_build_data.do`: extracts, cleans, and compiles datasets referenced above to generate the dataset used in the main analysis.
- The program `analysis/scripts/code/2.1_run_analysis.do`: generates all tables and figures based on the main analysis dataset produced in `1.1_build_data.do`.
- The program `analysis/scripts/code/3.1_build_data_1960.do`: modifies `1.1_build_data.do` to use non-wage income from 1960 rather than 1950 to predict non-wage income in 1940.
- The program `analysis/scripts/code/3.2_build_data_by_race.do`: modifies `1.1_build_data.do` to interact predictor variables with indicators for race when predicting pre-1940 income.
- The program `analysis/scripts/code/3.3_build_data_with_kids.do`: modifies `1.1_build_data.do` to include income earned at ages 14 and 15 in the computation of lifetime earnings.
- The program `analysis/scripts/code/3.4_build_data_cwscore_with_kids.do`: modifies `1.1_build_data.do` to use occupational income score rather than predicted individual income as the input to estimates of lifetime earnings.
- The program `analysis/scripts/code/4.1_run_analysis_robustness.do`: generates the data series plotted in Figure 9 based on the robustness analysis datasets produced in `3.1_build_data_1960.do` to `3.4_build_data_cwscore_with_kids.do`.
